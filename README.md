MatchIT represents a fresh mobile application launched in Serbia, often dubbed as the Tinder for job seekers. Users can effortlessly swipe through job opportunities, expressing interest and establishing a connection. Upon a successful match, users receive a message through MatChat, initiating communication with potential employers.

In my involvement with this initiative, I undertook the comprehensive testing of the entire application across diverse devices. The following encapsulates my key contributions to the project:

Conducting feature and regression testing encompassing both functionality and design aspects,

Formulating test cases utilizing methodologies such as Boundary Value Analysis and State Transition Technique,
Compiling detailed bug reports,
Proposing functional and visual enhancements,
Executing exploratory testing.
